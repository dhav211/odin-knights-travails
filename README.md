# Knights Travails

The final exercise for the data structures section of The Odin Project. Interestingly I studied this algorithim back in 2018 while learning a basic pathfinding algorithim for roguelike games, still a pretty gold standard if you don't have any sorts of weights or anything. I did get to learn some about graphs and how to represent them, which was interesting. Honestly this task was made fairly simple by the discovery of the adjacency list, without it I'm not sure how I'd tackle it as quickly.

Even though the section of DSAs is ending, I do want to continue learning them as I found them quite fascinating, I should really get my computer science degree.
